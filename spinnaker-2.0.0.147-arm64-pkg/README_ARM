===============================================================================
1. DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

To install Spinnaker on Linux you will need to have a few prerequisite
libraries installed.  Below is a list of libs that Spinnaker depends on.

Required:
1) libusb-1.0-0 (version 1.0.17 or greater recommended)

Strongly recommended:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:   Linux kernel version 4.4.19-35 or later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install these dependencies, the most straightforward approach is to use your
system's built-in package management utility. In the case of Ubuntu, the utility
is named "apt". Below is a set of one-line commands that can be used to install
all the required dependencies for various releases of Ubuntu Long Term Support
(LTS).

Ubuntu 16.04:
user$:  sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0


===============================================================================
2. SPINNAKER INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

Once all the dependencies are installed, just install the Spinnaker deb files.
There are eight different packages that need to be installed.

The Spinnaker packages are:
- libspinnaker-<version>_<platform>.deb
- libspinnaker-<version>_<platform>-dev.deb
- libspinnaker-c-<version>_<platform>.deb
- libspinnaker-c-<version>_<platform>-dev.deb
- spinupdate-<version>_<platform>.deb
- spinupdate-<version>_<platform>-dev.deb
- spinnaker-<version>_<platform>.deb
- spinnaker-doc-<version>_<platform>.deb

The packages with a preceding 'lib' are all the shared objects and their
respective dev packages.  The spinnaker-doc package contains our documentation in
pdf format (located in /usr/share/doc/spinnaker-doc).

To install these packages, we provide an easy to use install script. You can
run the script in the same directory that you have unpacked the software into.
The install script is called 'install_spinnaker_arm.sh'

code eg:
user$ sudo sh install_spinnaker_arm.sh

This script will install all the Spinnaker libraries, example code, example
apps and documentation.  The Spinnaker install script will also ask you to
configure udev so that a user will be able to use the USB devices.  If
you choose to configure the USB devices this script will change
permissions on the nodes to give this particular user full read and write
access to the device nodes.  It will overwrite the default Ubuntu permissions.
After running this script everything should be installed and set up for use.

Unfortunately restarting udev doesn't seem to set the permissions on the device
nodes immediately.  You may need to restart the machine before the user can
access the device nodes.

===============================================================================
3. USB CAMERA SETUP
===============================================================================

By default, USB-FS on Linux systems only allows 16 MB of buffer memory for all
USB devices. This may result in image acquisition issues from high-resolution
cameras or multiple-camera set ups. This limit must be increased to make use of
the imaging hardware's full capabilities.

This method applies to Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 standard installations. For ARM boards
running other distributions, see our article on Using Spinnaker on ARM and Embedded Systems:
<https://www.flir.com/support-center/iis/machine-vision/application-note/using-spinnaker-on-arm-and-embedded-systems/>

The Spinnaker installer asks to automatically set the appropriate USB-FS memory
settings, but you can also run the configuration script at any time:

    $ sudo sh configure_usbfs.sh

To manually configure the USB-FS memory:

    1. If the /etc/rc.local file does NOT already exist on your system, run the
       following commands to create and make it executable

        $ sudo touch /etc/rc.local
        $ sudo chmod 744 /etc/rc.local

    2. Open the /etc/rc.local file in any text editor,

        $ sudo nano /etc/rc.local

    and paste the following command at the end of the file:

        sh -c 'echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'

    3. Save your changes and close the file.

    4. Restart the machine.

To confirm that the memory limit has been updated, run the command:

    $ cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb

If this fails to set the memory limit, one can TEMPORARILY modify the
USB-FS memory until the next restart by running the following command:

    $ sudo sh -c 'echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'

If using multiple USB3 cameras, the USB-FS memory limit may need to exceed 1000.

===============================================================================
4. SPINNAKER REMOVAL
===============================================================================

To remove Spinnaker just run the uninstall script that we provide.  The
removal script will also remove the udev rules therefore restoring the original
ubuntu permissions on the device nodes.

code eg:
user$: sudo sh remove_spinnaker_arm.sh


===============================================================================
5. RUNNING PREBUILT UTILITIES
===============================================================================

In addition to prebuilt examples (eg: Acquisition, ChunkData, etc),
along with the source code for these examples, Spinnaker SDK also ships a tool
for upgrading firmware (ie: SpinUpdateConsole).

To make using these tools more convenient, Spinnaker SDK ships with a few
command-line scripts used to automatically set the appropriate environment
variables so these tools can be run from any PWD via the command-line, or when
launching the tools via a custom icon/shortcut. To run the following tools,
simply invoke their "launcher" command via the command line, and you will not
have to change the PWD to "/usr/bin" or modify environment variables in order
to launch them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1. SpinUpdateConsole
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SpinUpdateConsole: A console application for updating the firmware on FLIR cameras.
Location:   /usr/bin/SpinUpdateConsole
Short Name: SpinUpdateConsole
Launcher:   SpinUpdateConsole


===============================================================================
6. Troubleshooting Notes
===============================================================================

A summary for streaming FLIR machine vision cameras using FlyCapture2 or
Spinnaker SDK on ARM based embedded boards can be found at:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 TROUBLESHOOT GIGE CAMERA SETUP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To setup your network interface to use GigE cameras, run ifconfig and find the
network adapter that you intend to use the cameras on (eg. enp15s0):

code eg:
user$: ifconfig

Then, open up /etc/network/interfaces in a text editor (as sudo):

code eg:
user$: sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces

and add the following lines (change enp15s0 to match the one shown in ifconfig):

    iface enp15s0 inet static
    address 169.254.0.64
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    mtu 9000

    auto enp15s0

If using multiple interfaces, ensure that the addresses used are on different subnets
(eg. 169.254.0.64 and 169.253.0.64).

Lastly, restart the network service to apply the new settings:

code eg:
user$: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

You may need to restart the machine before the new interface settings are applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 TROUBLESHOOT GIGE STREAM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Linux systems, you may experience poor streaming performance due to lost data
packets. To improve streaming performance, you can adjust the some settings on the
camera side as well as on the system side. Full instructions on making these changes
can be found at:
<https://www.flir.com/support-center/iis/machine-vision/knowledge-base/lost-ethernet-data-packets-on-linux-systems>
